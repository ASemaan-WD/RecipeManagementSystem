# Recipe Management System - General Specs

## Origin

This project is part of an internal AI assessment at the company. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in AI-assisted development by building a complete, deployed product using AI tools (Claude, Cursor).

**Assessment version chosen:** Version 3 - Recipe Management System

## What This Project Is

A web-based recipe management system that allows users to manage recipes, tag and organize them, search by various criteria, and leverage AI-powered features for cooking inspiration and meal planning.

## Required Features (from Assessment)

### Core Features

- **Recipe Management:** Add, edit, and delete recipes (name, ingredients, instructions, and metadata)
- **Status Tagging:** Mark recipes as "favorite," "to try," or "made before"
- **Search:** Find recipes by name, ingredient, cuisine type, or preparation time
- **AI Features:** Implement AI-powered features (open-ended, creativity encouraged)

### Required Extras

- **Multi-user Support:** User accounts with sharing capabilities
- **Deployment:** App must be deployed and accessible via a live URL
- **Source Code:** GitHub repository with a README explaining how to run
- **Creative Features:** Additional features to demonstrate creativity

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion         | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Completeness      | Does the product work and cover the core features?  |
| Creativity        | Are extra features and creative ideas incorporated? |
| Product Quality   | Is the product clean and organized?                 |
| Usability         | Is the app intuitive?                               |
| AI Implementation | Was the application purely implemented with AI?     |

## Constraints

- Deadline: Monday (submitted via Teams or email)
- Deliverables: GitHub repo link + deployed/live version link
- Must be built using AI tools (Claude, Cursor)

## Development Approach

This project follows a structured role-based planning approach:

1. **Product Manager** defines what to build and user-facing requirements
2. **CTO** defines the technology stack, architecture, and infrastructure
3. **Senior Developer** defines the implementation plan, code structure, and execution details

Each layer builds on the decisions from the previous one. See the corresponding spec files for details.
